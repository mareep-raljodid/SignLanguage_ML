A Machine Learning Model trained on American sign language Dataset to predict the letters or numbers from a picture of a hand doing a certain sign.



- Datasets provided by Kaggle [unpublished]
- Model based on using Convulations and Prediction using RELU activation on Gradient Descent.
- Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
- Accuracy Score with validation set: 95%

#### Information about the files present here:

- env_name: Required Packages for runtime and dependencies.

- Pretrained_Model: Contains the checkpoints and epocs saved model which took a total of 13 hours to train. 
  You're Welcome :)

- photo/picture [jpg]: photo.jpg is R and picture.jpg is D, these are test images and examples of how an ideal image that can be accurately predicted by this model looks.

- SL_fullNB.ipynb: The full python notebook containing the script snippets to train and predict.

- SL_independent.py: Full python script to self train and predict images.

- SL_quickPredict: Predicts an image based on the saved model, no training required, 13 hours saved. Again, you're welcome :)
