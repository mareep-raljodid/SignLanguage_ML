@keras_export('keras.mixed_precision.experimental.Policy')
class Policy(object):
  """A dtype policy for a Keras layer.

  A dtype policy determines the computation dtype and the variable dtype of a
  Keras layer. Each layer has a policy. Policies can be passed to the 'dtype'
  argument of layer constructors, or a global policy can be set with
  'tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.set_policy'. A layer will default to
  the global policy if no policy is passed to it's constructor.

  For most models, each layer will have the same computation dtype and variable
  dtype, which will typically be float32. However, when mixed precision
  training is used, most layers will instead have a float16 computation dtype
  and a float32 variable dtype. See [this
  link](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/mixed-precision-training/index.html)
  for more information on mixed precision training. When the variable dtype does
  not match the computation dtype, variables will be automatically casted to the
  computation dtype to avoid type errors.

  In the near future, policies will also determine the loss scaling algorithm
  for Keras models.

  Policies are constructed by passing a string to the constructor, e.g.
  `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.Policy('float32')`. The string
  determines the compute and variable dtypes. Currently, it can be one of
  in one of the following forms:

    * Any dtype name, such as 'float32' or 'float64'. Both the variable and
      compute dtypes will be that dtype.
    * '<dtype>_with_float32_vars', where <dtype> is any dtype. The compute dtype
      will be <dtype>, while the variable dtype is float32. This is intended for
      the use of mixed precision, which uses float16 or bfloat16 for most
      computations, and float32 for variables. This policy is only useful if
      <dtype> is float16 or bfloat16, although <dtype> is allowed to be any
      dtype. Note we will have a "mixed" policy in the future, which will make
      it even easier to use mixed  precision by enabling other features such as
      loss scaling.

  ### How to use mixed precision in layers with Policies

  To use mixed precision in a model, the 'float16_with_float32_vars' policy can
  be used. `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.set_policy` can be used to set
  the default policy for layers if no policy is passed to them. Note loss
  scaling must also be done, e.g. with a
  `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer`. For example

  ```python
  tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.set_policy(
      'float16_with_float32_vars')
  model = tf.keras.models.Sequential(
      tf.keras.layers.Input((100,)),
      # Dense layers use global policy of 'float16_with_float32_vars'
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10),
      # Softmax should be done in float32 for numeric stability. We pass
      # dtype='float32' to use float32 instead of the global policy.
      tf.keras.layers.Activation('Softmax', dtype='float32')
  )
  opt = tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer(...)
  ... # Train `model` with `opt`.
  ```

  Alternatively, the policy can be passed to individual layers instead of
  setting the global policy with `set_policy`:

  ```python
  policy = tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.Policy(
      'float16_with_float32_vars')
  model = tf.keras.models.Sequential(
      tf.keras.layers.Input((100,)),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, dtype=policy),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, dtype=policy),
      # Softmax should be done in float32 for numeric stability.
      tf.keras.layers.Activation('Softmax', dtype='float32')
  )
  opt = tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer(...)
  ... # Train `model` with `opt`.
  ```

  As the above example shows, strings can be directly passed to layer
  constructors in the `dtype` argument instead of policies, but only if the
  string is convertible to a dtype.

  ### The deprecated "infer" policy

  In addition to a dtype or "<dtype>_with_float32_vars", a policy can also be
  "infer". This Policy is deprecated, and it is not recommended. When a layer
  has an infer policy, it will infer the computation and variable dtype from
  the first input the first time the layer is called.

  Once the layer is called for the first time, the layer's policy will change to
  the dtype of the first input.

  Similarly to "infer", there is a deprecated "infer_with_float32_vars" policy
  that infers the compute dtype, but not the variable dtype.

    intermediate format with higher precision than [b]float16, to increase
    numeric stability.
